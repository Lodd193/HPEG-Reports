When being discharged, they were told that somebody would call them within 24-48 hours for an appointment to attend the house and carry out physio.  He is adamant that he was told that this would be somebody from the QE hospital – why did this not take place, resulting in him having to bring her back into the hospital.

Father was diagnosed with Oesophagus cancer. His consultant Upper GI surgeon, aimed at a cure by arranging chemotherapy followed by surgery. His operation took place on 17th January 2024 at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham for minimally invasive Oesophagectomy but this unfortunately led to serious complications, resulting with him going on life support in ICU. However, after being there for over 3 months and despite all odds he was eventually discharged and came home on 20th April 2024 to continue is recovery.Therefore as a grieving family with unanswered questions
1. How did the cancer spread when we had been told it had all been removed?
2. How did the cancer go undetected after being in the QE Hospital for over 3 months?
3. Was the cancer missed on previous scans whilst at QE hospital between 17 January - 20 April?
4. Should we have received any information or follow up communication from the medical professional team who my father was under explaining how or why this happened? Or is it not their responsibility once their patient has died?

Explained that this is a government app (and not a picture) where the ID is maintained live. For your purposes, the app-based ID  was presenting can be likened to the recently digitised UKVI visas, like the BRP, which I understand is the only valid ID many BRP holders will have in the UK once their physical cards expire. Hannocke refused that ID too, saying she needs a physical ID that she can scan and send to her admin team to check how I will be billed. The fact that she would scan and digitise the physical ID anyway confused me, and receptionist dismissed any follow-up questions, maintaining that she would not accept anything but a physical ID.

ZK 16:58 19/05/2025 - I placed a call to complainant at 16:58 on 19/05/2025. He advised that he has is not happy and feels that it is all a cover up. He advised Dr Mohammed told hiom to log it as a complaint because both tumours were evident from the scans and can't understand how it was missed during the initial operation. He advised when he came in for his second operation whilst he was preparing for theatre on the ward a Dr came (south african) to him and tried to intimdate him by saying we heard you're not happy with how the surgery went too which he replied no, i am not because you didn't remove it all so i have had to come back in again for a second surgery. To which dr replied ""well what do you know, you aren't a doctor"". Whilst he was being administered anathesia in theatre he said Dr Singh came in and said ""i heard you are not happy with the surgery to which you saod i am just going into surgery, the previous dr got his back up and now he felt Dr Singh was trying to explain the reason for why the tumopur was missed. Richard asked him to leave and said this nit the time nor the place. I have advised Richard that this case was assigned to me recently and i will try and get a quick turn around for him but it may breach the due date. He is happy with this. He advises he has already had a meeting so will opt for a written response and follwoing this he will go to the Ombudsman if he still reminas unhappy. He advises that oif it was missed iin error then for staff to be truthful and own up to their mistake but he feel that through conversations with everyone their stories keep changing which has led him to belive that something is being covered up.

14 hours later – in the early hours of 30th -she received a call from the hospital and was told patient had a haemorrhage- cardiac arrest which has led to severe brain damage. Doctors advised the haemorrhage was caused by the poisoning – but after thinking it through more and speaking to other people she believes something is not right and it is connected to the bleeding.

Tissue Viability Nurses have assessed her on Ward 518 – her care home say she did not have this before she left for ED.

ZK 10/06/2025 12:53 - Placed a call to patients mother today and informed them of the breach and advised we are loooking to streamline theor daughters care so that the metabolic team are involved for all her presentations to the hospital. She thanked me and advised her daughter has been in hospital from Friday 6 June 2025.

ZK 10/06/2025 12:35 - Returned call from Ciaran Basketfield. He advised that because the metabolic team were never informed of the patients presenmtation he feels they cannot answer any of the concerns but rather Ciran will liaise withh colleagues to determine of a clear pathway can be developed tailored for the patient and then come back to me.

ZK 05/06/2025 18:03 - Placed a call to patients father today. I explained that we may breach the due date for him to reciev his response letter as we are still waiting on comments from one dr. I explained i am off on annual leave tomorrow but i have sent an email for the comments to be sent to me by tomorrow so we can aim to get it to him before it breaches. I explained my senior leadership are cc'd in the email and will support in trying to get this signed off tomorrow. He expressed that he wishes for the metabolic team to be more involved in his daugjhter's care from when she enters the ED department to when she is dicscharged. I asked how he feels the metabolic team could assist and expressed for them to ensure timely implentation of his daughter's medical emergewncy care plan.  i.e have her bloodworks been done, has her IV medication been made up and has she been cannulated. He expressed the ED team always struggle to cannulate her and this delays her treatment. He also mentioned that her care at the children's hospital was very good but feels since her transition to QEHB there seems to be a catalogue of errors. He expressed the metabolic team in Manchester are very good and asks if the team here are willing to liaise with them to gain a wider understanding of the steps that need to be taken when his daughter has a crisis. I explained i will speak with leadership and vunerablilites next week to determine of we there is anything further we can offer to tighten and streamline the care plan some more. He thanked me and said he would like for me to call him back next week.

Acknowledgement sent reference relayed to James ","Escalation and Management of Complaint Behaviour:

This complaint has become increasingly complex since it was first received. Persistent contact with services, including episodes of aggressive behaviour, has presented ongoing challenges in engaging constructively with the patient.

Staff are advised to log any concerning incidents onto RADAR, particularly where further contact involves aggressive or abusive behaviour. In line with our communication protocol, staff should issue up to 3 clear warnings during any interaction where behaviour is inappropriate or hostile. 

If the behaviour continues despite these warnings, the call may be terminated in accordance with Trust policy.

This approach is intended to protect staff wellbeing while ensuring that all patients are treated fairly and respectfully. Please remain vigilant and document any incidents thoroughly.",Not upheld,,,Male,Indian

He has been diagnosed with cancer (scale 6) 
On contacting him following the clinic appointment he has advised he wishes to raise a formal complaint. He feels the delays in responding to his high PSA results and lack of treatment for prostatitis have meant his cancer has grown. He has asked for his prostate to be removed and hope it is not too late to have stopped the cancer spreading. He has a 7year old son and does not want to die

He is unsure of the dates of his bloods etc but advises he had a blood test which saw his PSA raised and the consultant said he would do another blood test and if it was raised again he would refer him to the appropriate consultant. The second set of bloods were raised but there was no referral and later a third set of bloods was taken which again were raised and still no referral.  The patient contacted his GP who was the person who pushed for action on his high PSA. He feels Mr Natalwala was only ever interested in his bladder and trying different medications for that than dealing with his prostate. 


1. Why did the consultant treat him this way? The patient feels it was race related.
2. Why were the high PSA blood results ignored, and he was not referred for further investigation?
3.After the patients first biopsy he should have had a follow up scan and he did not, why not?
4. Why didn't they treat him for his prostatitis?

He has advised that he anticipates Dr Moore was the clinician who saw his mother in the morning however, his concern related to the clinician who reviewed his mother's knee in the afternoon and deeming that her knee was okay and she would be fit for discharge. After the complainant requested that this be reflected in the notes he raised this with the nurse for a second opinion who asked two registrars to review the patient who drained fluid and the patient was admitted for a further week.  Complainant has advised that the concerns relate to this clinician deeming the patient to be okay despite her being in pain and her knee being swollen.

Patient raised a complaint in 2018.  She says the information in the complaint response (see attached point 2) by Dr  is not on her medical records. When she attended a recent Cardiology appointment, the information about the procedure completed by Dr  could not be seen. She believes this should be uploaded to her medical records.  Also regarding the complaint, when her initial enquiry was taken by PALS, I could not find the complaint on datix records. She says this caused her anxiety. I had reassured her that I would make an enquiry (an email inquiry was sent to Complaints) and this was located on the O: drive.  A copy of the letter has been posted to Pt. today. She is not happy that I was not able to locate the response initially. 
2.	 Pt. requested that her pre-op appt of 28/01/25 was rearranged to a F2F appt due to having a speech impairment. IP bookings offered her a F2F appt for 04/03/25 and she accepted this.  KS. had a telephone conversation with Pt.  on 25/02/25 and explained about the pre-op clinics – see attached. On speaking to Mrs Fitter today, she does not accept this explanation and believes a reasonable adjustment should have been made for her to attend a F2F appt at either the QE or Solihull Hospital.

I did not complain that despite being told in Oct 2021 that my operation (mastectomy and breast reconstruction) was urgent I did not complain when it took until Feb 2022 to have the operation. I received the diagnosis two weeks after my mum died of cancer (and Ive previously lost my dad to cancer) but I understood when doctor said I had good cancer and waited
2.	I did not complain when I was in hospital that my pain relief drip was taken away at 10am and despite ringing the bell numerous times it took until the night shift to come on to receive pain killers (I still remember the lovely night shift nurses name was Rosie and she listened to me cry and gave me pain relief)
3.	I did not complain when I had my first annual mammogram on my other boob in March 2023 and it took until October 2023 to receive letter confirming all was ok (despite numerous calls requesting this) I did not complain when I had my second annual mammogram on 4th April 2024 and it took till end of June 2024 to get letter saying all was OK (3 months seemed better than the previous 6 months
Services are trying to engage with the patient and are attempting to arrange for her to be seen in clinic to discuss concerns and we've had some comments back re the mammogram (see attached correspondence). There is a chance we could have this resolved by the 5 day call, though I feel its important that we now have a written response to these concerns for further learning across the board.

In Sept 2024, there were told the referral for the clinic would be expedited. A further OPA was on 25/11/24.  The clinic letter from this appointment was not received by them at the time. A copy was obtained from their GP.  In this letter it said that a leaflet would be forwarded about a new drug for Pt. – drug named Nintedanib.  This leaflet never arrived and there were not given the opportunity to discuss the new drug.  They have since received the leaflet. They attended an OPA with Dr on 24/02/25.  They raised these issues and Dr Cheng apologised.  She says Dr said they would chase the referral for the rehab clinic but they are not hopeful this will happen. They think this may have benefited Pt. if he was offered the opportunity sooner. She says her husband is breathless and has been suffering.  She thinks he could have been helped sooner.  They have received the clinic letter from Dr Chdated 24/02/25. She says there are a few things wrong in this. In the diagnoses section, on page 2, item 5 – bladder cancer.  'Await further biopsy' is incorrect as this has been completed. On page 5, at the top where it says 'I have advised that they remember to' – she says none of this was discussed during the appointment

2.	 No one noticed Pt. had gone missing for nearly an hour until I arrived and told them, how long would it have been before reported?
3.	No one thought to ring next of kin to see if we knew where she was and technically to update us on the situation/ CCTV findings as she can get a little confused when anxious  and could have got on the wrong  bus, in a car, ran over etc etc,  the list is endless and scary to even think about.  As no one knew at the Hospital until the Doctor rang at 7pm, she was safe and at home!
4.	No one from the hospital or her doctors have even rang her to see if she is ok, as I believe an Echo was also needed and what the X-ray, blood test results were.
5.	Surely, switchboards should know peoples job titles to save time and put through correctly and have some sort of message service to pass on?

ZK 04/04/2025 12:24 - Complaint put on hold and Email sent to Am to inform her of this. I have emailed and attempted the advocate to gain more information but i am still a/w a response. The complaint case is very vague and following distribution to ward 518 and HIV, Matt Page advises that ""I would agree with Kaveh, that this letter is very non-specific, and the complaint isn't directed at a particular specialty/department"".

However, on review of the records, I would also be in agreement with Kaveh that this is likely directed towards our colorectal colleagues as there is evidenced dialogue regarding a disagreement with the management.

Reviewing the HIV specific letters, there does not appear to be any concerns related to our specialty.

Why did ED make him wait and suffer more for those few days?  She says she understands if the fluid could not be drained at the time, but she feels as if medics should have known he needed to be admitted, treated and seen by a specialist and not discharged home.  She says she thinks medics were ageist by sending him home with pain relief.  During his admission, her father had 3 litres of fluid drained. Daughter has said under no circumstances to contact either her father or mother.  Patient has since received a diagnosis for a terminal condition.

Care recieved was extremely below standard and subsequently put him at risk. He was moved from AMU to ward 11 in a bed where he was then removed from the bed and put in a chair in the middle of bay. With no blankets or dignity and to my knowledge was not given any medication or antibiotics. Who made the decision to take his bed away and deemed him 'fit to sit' given the previous 24-48 hours? Ultimately, my main concerns are :
1. Why was the decision made to remove him from a bed when this was clearly putting him at risk due to how poorly he was?
2. Why were no observations done whilst he was detiorating and what times were his antibiotics given? Were any observations done in the time between leaving AMU first thing that morning up until getting a bed at 3pm?
3. Why are unwell patients left uncomfortable with no dignity in the middle of wards just to support 'bed flow'?
4. Whilst in ward 11 but with no bed allocation and not showing on the ward's system who was responsible for his welfare and safety?

He went through all his concenrs from before Covid to when his mothers issues started and the lack of care and follow up recived from the dr's. He advises that all he wants is a treatment plan for his mother. He advised the dr's have not been supportive but rather passive aggressive, lack of empathy and he feels his mother has not been provided with any treatment options due to her age. He fears his mother may have a stroken and die due the delay in tretament. He advised that he will be compiling his mothers medical history along with all the interactions with the dr's and he willl be putting forward his case to the ICB for negligence. he may also go down the legal route if his mother is not given treatment. I provided  my direct contact details to him and advised he can call me should he need any further support. He thanked me for the call, stated it was nice to speak with me.

She says she has been diagnosed with MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome). Private consultation recommended a medication called sodium cromoglicate which would cost her £300 per month. Her GP is unable to help because it is hospital-only prescription.  Outcome of MDT was that there was no evidence of urticaria or clinical symptoms in keeping with mast cell degranulation – this has been diagnosed by a private allergist.  Suggested that if she needs the prescription that she goes back to the private allergist.

On Ward 621 he mothers catheter had burst and a HCA nurse told her daughter that she leaving her shift in 20 minutes and cannot help because it slow everything else down and that after the handover another nurse should support with chnaging the bed sheets. The complainant further waited for someone to help but advises she took pictures of the nurses advising they were not busy and were sat at nursing station talking about their cats.
On Harborne ward the complainant advises her mother had asked for an orange juice which took 3 hours to arrive. She advises that her  other last had a CT scan in Jaunary when she was advised the medical team suspected her mother to have cancer. She advises that her mothber is in need of another scan to determine how advanced the cancer is as she is due her surgery in July.

Patient was emotional on the phone and said she was told she will need to have another major surgery to correct this.
They also mentioned they have not encountered this before so don't know how they are going to correct this as they may not be enough bowel to join and she may end up with a colostomy bag. 

","RW - 23.05.2025 - Tom F advised case to be closed due to PSIRG - update email sent to complaint explaining - CASE CLOSED

RW - 23.05.2025 - note the complainant did not want a formal complaint logged and just wanted to speak to doctors. I note that Mr Fallis spoke with this lady on 23/04/2025,  will be seen in the clinic by Mr Shariff, and then this case will go PSIRG for investigation and M&M. Liaised with Bev who advised to ask Tom F if to launch complaint or close due to investigation. Asked Tom F in email for advise if he feels we should continue with a formal complaint investigation and response or close it due to the PSIRG investigation.

This ultrasound highlighted, a complex heterogenous cyst of a concerning size in excess of that reported by QEHB. This precipitated a CA125 blood test and Oncology Consultation the same week, creating a great deal of anxiety and distress for me over the following weeks.

My confidence in the reporting of the KUB scan has been greatly eroded and I am concerned that a more recent KUB CT Scan done on 21st January 2025, may have also been misinterpreted.

After reading your response and your reasoning behind the differential, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my KUB CT Scans with a Consultant Radiologist at QEHB, in order to fully understand and resolve this complaint.

She is disgusted by the lack of communication and with the before and after care, and that no information on the procedure was provided ahead of it. She feels it was all poorly organised. As the patient hadn't been aware of what to expect she had driven herself in and had to dive back home in pain and bleeding. She states the whole thing was a waste of everyone's time.

The notes for 22nd April state:
While these details are factually correct, key clinical actions and observations are missing, specifically:
1. A pregnancy test was carried out during this visit and confirmed to be positive. The clinician physically showed me the two lines on the test result.
2. A dipstick urine test was also performed. The clinician told me I had nitrates and blood in my urine and advised me that I had a UTI, that had been ""festering"".

3. I was prescribed Nitrofurantoin antibiotics during this same visit. I collected the medication from my pharmacy on the same day. I have since spoken to the pharmacy, who have provided a record of this prescription, confirming it came from the hospital on 22nd April 2025.
4. I raised the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy during the consultation. I told the clinician that my symptoms were in my womb, and this was the only explanation I could think of. She asked me to lie down, examined my abdomen, and reassured me that because the pain was central rather than one-sided, I should not worry about an ectopic pregnancy.
None of these significant interactions are recorded in my notes for that date.

At approximately 7:10pm, experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction, a life-threatening medical emergency requiring immediate and systematic clinical intervention. This reaction was witnessed and reported without delay by a relative to two registered professionals on duty at the time. Despite clear notification of the onset of a medical emergency, the response by both members of staff was wholly inadequate and failed to meet even the most basic standards of clinical care or professional conduct.  Was administered a single dose of 4mg Piriton, with no accompanying clinical observations, no escalation to medical staff, no monitoring, and no initiation of emergency procedures. Both staff members subsequently left the ward at the conclusion of their shift without taking any further action, leaving my condition to deteriorate.

Although we have not obtained the patient's consent to share care details, we can and should respond to this complaint. This approach is supported by:

•	Regulation 5 and Regulation 13 of the Local Authority Social Services and National Health Service Complaints (England) Regulations 2009, which allow complaints to be made on someone else's behalf and permit the response to be limited if consent is not provided.
•	The NHS Complaint Standards developed by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, which promote a consistent and proportionate approach to complaint handling. These standards recognise that organisations may respond to third-party complaints while respecting patient confidentiality and consent requirements. 

Our response letter therefore does not include any sensitive healthcare information and instead provides clarity on consent processes.

2.     Why was wife discharged given the diagnosis was unproven?
3.     Why were appointments with Breast Clinic, Haematology and PET not booked as a matter of urgency upon Acute Consultant 'diagnosis'?
4.     Why was my wife discharged on 15th May if RBC blood test results were unknown? QEHB IT systems were down and so any rational person would have expected all discharges to be halted.
5.     Diagnosis from discharge letter on 16th May Dr Neutropenic Sepsis, Unknown Primary? metastasis. 
6.     How did the consultant reach the conclusion that further tests in 'a frail elderly lady with likely metastatic malignancy (it) probably won't add much to the management'? The diagnosis was unproven and my wife was not presenting as a 'frail elderly lady'. We see this a serious failing on the part of the consultant.

In December 2024, while attending Solihull Hospital for a contrast dye CT scan, multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by the radiology staff to insert a cannula into my left hand. Unfortunately, during these repeated attempts, a nerve was damaged, and I have been experiencing continuous pain and discomfort in my left hand since that incident.
Second Incident – 28 May 2025 – Right Hand Nerve Damage:
Following my mastectomy on 27 May 2025, while still admitted, a blood sample was required on the morning of 28 May. I informed the attending night duty nurse (Nurse Siji) that my veins are difficult to access and requested that a trained phlebotomist be called to take the bloods. Despite my request and prior explanation, Nurse Siji, who stated she had 20 years of experience, proceeded to attempt the blood draw herself. Unfortunately, during the attempt, she failed to obtain blood and caused nerve damage to my right hand. During the procedure, I experienced severe pain and an electric shock-like sensation, which has persisted since.

1.	Was there medical negligence?
2.	How the brain condition is likely to have been caused? No medical explanation has been provided to me at the least to give me closure as to what could have caused the long-term condition.
3.	Elements of care have been underrated in responses such as 'staff commented we left happy' which are very vague comments and biased.
4.	All other responses were generic and vague and no apology in totality was provided for the poor service.

o	And what did the Drs see and not inform family of on the day of his admittance to hospital as everything that would have been done previously to treat him was not done. 
o	Why was he continuously given IV drips when he was already over loaded with water retention. When they knew they could not get rid of the water that was already in his system to be giving him more.
o	Why was treatment for him delayed

Admitted QEHB on 11th April 2025 to have a Wedge resection to remove a suspicious tumour which was picked up on a recent PET scan. When Pt. came round from the surgery the surgeon informed her they had removed the tumour and a second lesion from the upper LEFT lobe. This was a shock to her as she was unaware of a second lesion as nothing else had been picked up on the scans. Discharge paperwork stated 'a nodule' was removed so I was confused as to what had been done. The doctor on the ward round on day of discharge confirmed there had been a second lesion removed and histopathology should take around 3-4 weeks to come back.

•	Multiple appointments at least 4 were cancelled with consultant Anup - SU was told that Anup only had 1 day every 2 weeks for clinics. SU seen Anup at 33 weeks and birthed at 35 weeks. 
•	A different consultant delivered the twins who parent had not met - parent assumed it would be Anup given his speciality.
•	No porter available to take me down to my baby so for the first 2 days I had to reply on my partner when he came to take me down as I wasn't feeling up to walking, 
•	""it was horrible having to leave one of my babies on mat ward alone"" as I was told I couldn't take my baby down to my other baby on neonatal. 
•	Due to this I missed food and medication for myself - A midwife even said to me ""Are you feeling ok?  Do you want to go down and see your other baby then"".
•	Parent found it increasingly stressful trying not to miss baby checks for each of the babies as they were in different locations. No consideration was given for the parents navigating 2 doctors rounds.
•	When on Neonatal - the nurses were openly chatting in front of the SU about what babies were being seen by parents and indicated that SU baby was not seen frequently. 
•	Day 4 a lovely person from the Butterflys team came to me and said I can take my other twin down to neonatal and put him in the cot with my other baby - instantly they both settled. Why did this take 4 days? 
•	Noone came to see Pt. regarding in IF choices - She did get told ""someone on the ward would help - but no one came"". Parent gave formula. 
•	Badger diary app - Updated it the first day with a couple of messages as though from baby - but no other updates for day 2-5.  Why is this not being used?
•	I asked parent about consent and communication when she wasn't with her baby on neonatal - she said all examinations and assessments were done without consent and communication - this included feeding tube, heel prick, etc i was always told about them after when I visited.
•	Parent was advised that c-section wound would be assessed in community upon discharge - Pt. was told at discharge that she has stiches and staples - The midwife commented to her ""I didn't think we did both staples and stiches and proceeded to share that they will be removed in 7-10 days""

CASE CLOSED.

ZK 27/08/2025 12:39 - CharIene Mighten advises ""completed a capacity assessment with patient Indepth, and he did have capacity to make the decision to return home. 
We offered an access visit to review the property and offered him equipment and a package of care to manage his care needs. All help and support were declined by patient. Based on the mental capacity assessment he fell into the category of making and 'unwise decision'. Home without support was completely his choice and he did give his reasons for not having any support on discharge. ""

ZK 27/08/2025 12:29 - Darren confirmed the capacity assessments undertaken deemed the patient to have capacity to make informed decisons about this care so we will need to close this complaint down as we cannot obtain consent from patient. I did attempt to call the son and inform him of this but there was no answer so i have left a vm with my contact number for him to call me back on. I will advise that if in the future his dad changes his mind we will be be happy to look in to this again.

ZK 27/08/2025 08:17 - Darren asking if we have obtained consent because the dad presented with capacity. Darren advises the dad refused treatment and the sons do not agree with the dad's decisions. I had attempted to call the dad but there was no answer so i placed a call to the son who expressed his frustration at the fact that he has shared his complaint with the council, social servise, safeguarding and UHB but Dad is not providing consent so we will most likely need to close this complaint. Dareen will send me an account of the capacity assesment. I will then close the complaint and advise the son of this.

08/07/25- Complainant has contacted LO and had a detailed telephone discussion.  Identified that point 4 relates to SWBH and that the GP had referred patient to their services rather than UHB,  main elements relate to GP delays.  To determine who is best placed managing this complaint. I do not think UHB elements are big enough to be the lead organisation. 
08/07/25- LO has emailed complainant to clarify elements of their complaint.  Complainant seeking response to overcall care received from 2008-2025 however, this relates to numerous organisations which includes Birmingham Children's Hospital, Worcester Hospital, GP practices and UHB.  Some elements of complaint are not reflected on patient's UHB records as theres no referalls received besides patient being seen in 2012 and then later referred in 2024.  Complex and not easy to identify . 
03/07/2025- LO has reviewed the complainant,  a large percentage of the complaint relates to other NHS organisations such as BSOL ICB (GP), Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH) and Worcester hospital.  A few elements for UHB but appears to be BCH who have the most elements.

She asked me to send her an email so that she can send me the email correspondence with Ellis Winter, who Dr King's secratary along with a more detailed account of the events. I explained i need to send this out for statements by Tuesday at the latest amd she said she would do it over the weekend and send it across to me via email. She thanked me and said that i have made her feel alot better as she felt heard. I also stated i would reach out to the Women's hospital and request if an endometriosis specialist would review her as Dr King will not speak to her now. She feels like he has shooed her off. She is deeply unhappy that the MRI scan identified adhesions connecting her womb to her bladder (latter two joined together bc of adhesions), this was communicated to her via her GP but two weeks later Dr King sent out a letter stating there were no findings. When she challenged him on this conflicting information she said he was quite dismissive and said well we can't do anything. As a result she will be informing the Ombudsman and ICB. I had also made some additonal notes on the complaint form.

Response to be sent to Claire Shannon, Adult Social Care who is leading on complaint; Beverley Bellerby confirmed no consent required as ""best interest"".","RW - 25.07.2025 - Teams call completed with Phillip Shakeshaft where I advised him of discussion with Richard Lodder, and that he will need to complete an internal investigation and respond as first requested. Please see attached emails for full details. Provided Phil with CDN questions I pulled from complaint to assist in his internal investigation, and requested that he contact Claire Shannon to update her that the formal complaint is closed and that he will complete investigation and response.
COMPLAINT CLOSED 


RW - 24.07.2025 - Reviewed concerns and compiled questions from complaint into a draft letter template. Noted that complaint came from Adult Social Care Solihill MBC when I was about to launch it to the departments. Upon further review I note that Claire Shannon (Adult Social Care, Solihull MBC) originally advised Phill Shakeshaft (General Manager - Complex Discharge Hubs) that the complaint was not for formal investigation, but is for Phillip to review, consider any learning, and report back to Home First only. I note after a conversation with Claire it was then requested to go through the formal complaints process due to multiple sites. Liaised with Lorna, Marg, and Adrianne - Lorna advised that under National Health Service Complaints Reg 2009 Section 8b, this complaint should not be going through the formal complaints process and advised to liaise with Rich. Informed Rich of above and asked for advice if I should continue to launch the complaint though the formal complaint process or go back to Philip Shakesaft to advise it is for him to review and report to Home First. as I was uncertain about how to move forward since the complainant is not seeking a response, and the request for a response is directed towards an NHS body for the purpose of learning. Rich advised that the case does not fall under legislation 8B. Replied back to Rich to ask if I should still launch the case or return to Phill as the complainant is not aware of the complaint and did not request a formal investigation. Rich advised that based on the original email, this shouldn't be in the complaints process and there is no action for us, and this if for Phil to investigate locally. Email sent to Phill requesting him to advise when able to discuss case. I will then advise him of the above information and close the case.

Email sent to Bhavna Gokani, Dr Rweyemamu, Dr Sivaraman, Marg and CDG3 inbox. CCed DON for CDG2 and Bev for information. Asked CDG 3 management to review complaint and  advise if they feel this should be investigated as a serious incident, and if we can close the formal complaint.

•	Stroke concerns: PT.  initially presented with symptoms strongly indicative of a third stroke in February 2025, but despite repeated requests, an MRI was delayed for three weeks. By that point, she had already lost her ability to speak. We are still waiting for appropriate follow-up support, including assessment by the Speech and Language Therapy team. No concrete rehabilitation plan has been communicated to us.

1.	Fall under paramedic care: While being assisted out of the ambulance, ankle collapsed and fell, causing immediate pain.
2.	X ray confirmation: The radiographer informed  that the X ray clearly showed a fracture in my ankle and explained possible treatments (cast, boot, CT scan, surgery).
3.	Dismissal by doctor: Despite visible swelling and X ray evidence, the doctor refused treatment, claiming  injury was ""psychological,"" denied mobility aids, and refused a second opinion.
4.	Unsafe discharge:  left to leave A&E unsupported, in visible distress, until a paramedic re intervened and directed me to another hospital.
5.	Outcome at second hospital: A second X ray at Russell Hays confirmed the fracture; I am now in a boot and referred to fracture clinic.
This represents a serious failure of duty of care, likely causing further pain and trauma. I request:
•	A full investigation into the A&E doctor's conduct;
•	Documentation and review of all clinical and radiological records;
•	Explanation of how the clear X ray findings were ignored;
•	Measures to prevent similar ""psychological dismissal"" of real injuries;
•	Confirmation that this is recorded as a Patient Safety Incident.

Upon arrival at Sherbourne Grange staff carried out the standard admission assessment, including body map and skin integrity check, and discovered pressure sores on both feet. These wounds appear to have been acquired at Heartlands hospital Ward 1, yet there was no mention of them in the discharge summary, nor were Sherbourne Grange staff informed verbally at any point.

This lack of critical clinical information not only delayed the initiation of appropriate wound care but also placed David at increased risk of infection, pain and deterioration, and compromised the continuity of care expected during transition.

Observations that were never carried out
•  A pain score of 0, which is inaccurate

When they sent discharge note to GP they put it down to gastroenteritis.
The next day patient couldn't eat and was in agony with pain getting worse, so she went to SH where they did a urine sample and checked temp, they said it is the gallbladder so wrote a letter and told her to go back to Heartlands immediately.
Patient went straight to ward 19 where they did more tests and scans where it turned out she has sepsis and perforated gallbladder. 
Patient was very upset as this could have been dealt with earlier when she initially went to A&E with her symptoms.
They couldn't remove gallbladder as it was too dangerous for them with risk of sepsis going into blood stream.

Believe that serious failings in his care contributed to his decline and eventual death.
Concerns 
Despite these plans, we are concerned that:
1. Delays occurred in arranging the PET scan and stem cell transplant, leaving patientvulnerable to disease progression.
2. Communication between teams (haematology, cardiology, and the GP) was poor, leading to confusion about his medication management and care pathway.
3. Opportunities for earlier intervention may have been missed, despite his clear chemo-sensitive response, reducing his chances of a successful outcome.
4. As a result, patient's health deteriorated, and he sadly passed away.

Patient has been waiting most of the day to be seen by doctor.
Arrived at 12pm – it was now nearly 9pm and no doctor had seen patient.
A nurse came back and mentioned there is problem with  dimer which caused daughter to panic as she knows what this means considering mums medical history. Daughter was concerned her mum could have a pulmonary embolism. Eventually Dr  came on shift, daughter stated she expressed her concerns regarding her mum and delays for her to be seen - from the first interaction her attitude was off, 'if looks could kill', doctor was not professional, not listening and refused to see mum. In the end mum had to be seen by another Dr who was understanding.
Daughter wants to raise complaint about this doctor and her attitude which was inappropriate at the time and how she dealt with the situation.

•	Delay in specialist referral and inadequate early intervention despite abnormal liver enzyme results and jaundice.
•	Lack of communication regarding test results, scans, and treatment plans, leaving the family uninformed.
•	Failure to provide daily medical reviews as required for a case of this severity.
•	Neglect of basic care needs: his catheter bag was often left full, hygiene standards were poor, and my father was left unattended for long periods without being cleaned or repositioned.
•	Unnecessary or unexplained medication: paracetamol was given regularly without justification.
•	Discrimination and lack of dignity: staff dismissed my role as translator, showed disrespect when he spoke his own language, and a nurse named Aney in particular discriminated against my family.
•	Denial of family contact: when the ward was closed due to flu, we were not allowed to speak with or reassure my father. Requests to explain the situation to him by phone were refused. This deprived him of the comfort of his loved ones during his final days, leaving him frightened and alone.
•	Delay in informing the family of his deterioration: we were only told three days after doctors knew his condition was worsening, despite being present daily and providing contact details.
•	Undignified end-of-life care: staff failed to provide privacy or compassion during his last moments, with nurses staring through curtains as he lay dying.
•	Poor hygiene standards: throughout his admission, I observed inadequate cleaning and infection control, which may have contributed to his decline.

The treatment experienced left me in unnecessary pain and distress, believes that both herself and baby were put at risk due to the standard of care provided.
Following my caesarean, wound was incorrectly stapled, with staples doubled up on top of each other. This caused significant pain and complications with my recovery as it has now led to an infection.
Prescribed medication was not ready for collection until three days after discharged, leaving  without the essential pain relief and treatment I required during that time.
Wound began leaking, was scheduled for a scan just four days postpartum. During this procedure, the sonographer pressed down firmly on my wound site, which was extremely painful and inappropriate given the circumstances. Lack of inadquate nursing care

Feeling ignored, I contacted breast care nurses, who reiterated that if the doctor had no concerns, neither did they. My GP later referred me to dermatology, where after several appointments—including a biopsy in June 2025—I was diagnosed on 14 July 2025 with basal cell carcinoma of the nipple, and treatment began immediately. On 6 August 2025, I learned my upcoming breast clinic appointment was canceled due to a system change I was never informed about. Given this misdiagnosis and my history, I am requesting a detailed breast scan (not just a mammogram) to check for duct involvement, as Dr. Sundaramoorthy failed to address my concerns and overlooked cancer symptoms.","15.12.25- Signed response posted to complainant

She has Parkinson and onset dementia so her husband was there with her al night..
Respect form was done at 06.46am but nothing was discussed with her husband/ NOK.
Later that afternoon she got a call saying she needs to come in.
When she arrived her mum was not there as she was taken for a scan. She was told that her mum is really poorly, they are trying but family need to prepare for the worst. 
They were then given a family room between majors B and resus. 
A doctor came and said to grandson without checking who he is – that patient has had a heart attack and has a tear in heart.
Why did this doctor not tell patient's husband/ NOK or her other three children, why did he tell grandson whilst they were present or he could have gathered the family together.

Patient passed away the following day.
They did not do anything to save her.
They didn't give a full explanation as to why they are not saving her
They made a decision to leave a 67 year old to die, what was their rationale behind this.
They did not discuss with the family any other options/ treatment.
Daughter said she has a lot of unanswered questions and wants a complaint to be raised so she can get some answers. ",11.12.25 - Sent for sign off; Case closed,"8.12.25 ST - Sent for QA1 review - comments received by Dr Thompson today

Why did it take 6 weeks (post scoping etc) to realise that a second allograft would not be possible?
Why was the patient told that the NHSE had rejected commissioning of the second allograft when nothing was ever submitted to the ICB for funding approval? It was the Birmingham Haematology team who took the decision not to pursue funding due to the published NHS commissioning criteria.
Why did the Director of Transplants need to seek counsel to raise an IFR and why were they not aware of the process?
Why did the Director of Transplants agree to submit an IFR but then retract this due to not gaining MDT approval? 
Why did they not know that they needed to gain MDT approval?
Why did the MDT not agree to an IFR request being raised as the budget is not held by them and are not allowing the patient a chance to have her case heard by their local ICB together with her MP. 
Patient asked to attend the next MDT to put forward her case but was told this was not possible and there were no further routes to appeal the decision. How can you not have an appeals process that does not involve the patient?

4. Why an aspiration was attempted in the wrong area, causing unnecessary pain and potential harm.
5. Why a pattern of repeated dismissal has occurred despite clear evidence of Seroma in previous visits.
6. What steps will be taken to ensure patients are treated with professionalism, respect, and accuracy in future.
NB:  Patient states the admission date was 27.09, but according to Portal it was 03.10.

Patient also sent in another email regarding another visit to A&E on 03.11 re the same issues and has requested an urgent ultrasound-guided aspiration procedure.

First call came in at 9.50am and he did not speak. Then I called the hospital back several times saying is he calling me back and the nurse John said he had tried 3 times which is a lie as I had no miss calls from the hospital. I said I want to make a complaint and then I got a call straight away. The doctor then said no fracture etc and was about to get off the phone. Please request a recoding of this call which wa approx 10.50am I said I have the report so tell me what it showed again he then read it and I said it is showing somthing. He said yes early arthritis and we only deal with fractures/trauma and I can come in next week. I refused to come in as he didn't say for what I said what will you be doing as I still have pain and am not weight bearing on right hand. You won't just do nothing you have to refer me. Finally got a referral but maybe to the wrong department. This is unacceptable behaviour by the hospital and doctor. I pay my taxes to be seen if I have an issue. I am right handed and am experiencing so much pain for a doctor to just disregard it and do nothing about it. I understand it is not a fracture but signpost me to another department. If I have onset of artiritis surely this had to be actioned now. Or do the nhs have a habit of doing nothing unless it gets worse I want ti make a complaint ,"19.12.25 - QA1 - Submitted for QA1 via drafting support (JD)

RW - 21.11.2025 - I contacted the complainant at her request to discuss her concerns and explain the complaints process. During the conversation, the complainant was articulate and appeared to have capacity.
I outlined the complaints procedure and confirmed that her concerns regarding Ward 16 are under investigation, and she will receive a written response. The complainant expressed dissatisfaction, stating she expected an immediate response and a consultant appointment to review her fall and ongoing leg pain, as she felt the ward doctors did not assess or diagnose her.
I explained that her discharge letter indicated no requirement for further follow-up and advised that she should contact her GP to discuss her current symptoms so appropriate treatment or referrals could be arranged. The complainant disagreed, stating she would escalate her concerns to the UHB CEO and other senior leaders to request a consultant review. I clarified that any complaint would still follow the formal process and reiterated that urgent clinical needs should be addressed via her GP as her primary care provider.
The complainant maintained that the hospital should arrange follow-up as she left without a diagnosis and advised she would not follow my recommendation. She confirmed she had seen her GP but did not disclose her symptoms, believing the GP should have known. I encouraged her to inform her GP of her symptoms to enable appropriate care, but she disagreed.
The call concluded with the complainant stating she would not contact her GP and would escalate her concerns to senior executives. I reiterated that her complaint about Ward 16 remains under investigation and again advised that her GP is best placed to address her current symptoms. The complainant thanked me for my time but confirmed she would not follow this advice.

Unsafe Discharge & Poor Follow-Up
Patient discharged while still suffering from sores. Health visitor expressed shock and advised urgent return to hospital. Subsequent readmission did not resolve issues before discharge again.

I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding the unsafe and failed discharge of Theresa Wolahan (TW), aged 99, from QE Hospital Birmingham on 14 November 2025. The discharge process lacked essential communication, medication provision, and clinical handover, resulting in a medical emergency and reconveyance to hospital. This incident has caused significant risk to the resident's health and safety and raises safeguarding concerns.
 
Chronology of Events
•	13 November 2025 ( 14:17):
A call was received from Nurse Ali on Ward 513 informing us that TW was fit for discharge. Diagnosis was stated as flu, and isolation was required for two further days. A Category 2 pressure ulcer to the sacrum was identified, and we requested hospital to complete the assessment for community district nurse follow-up. Discharge was agreed for Monday 17 November.
•	14 November 2025 (11:00):
A call was received from a nurse on Ward 513 stating transport had been booked and TW was on her way back to the home. This was unexpected as the home had not been informed of discharge today, nor had a handover been completed.
When queried, Nurse Ali admitted he had misread the isolation information and stated isolation had ended yesterday. When our team leader requested a proper handover, Nurse Ali responded that we were ""within our rights to complain and to name him"" before abruptly ending the call. No handover was provided.
•	Arrival at Home (12:10) :
 Transport staff commented, ""Wow, the ward was in a rush for the bed for this one,"" which reinforced our concerns about the unsafe discharge. Upon arrival, it was identified that TW had been prescribed Furosemide 20mg tablets, which were not sent with her.
•	14 November 2025 (13:40):
TW was seated at the dining table when she began agonal breathing and convulsing. She was placed in the recovery position and 999 was called. Paramedics were under the impression TW was under a further 2 days isolation as per her records they received.  NEWS Score of 8, SATS at 88 with 2L oxygen. TW was reconveyed to hospital. Paramedics confirmed they would raise a safeguarding alert for this failed discharge along with the call handler for the 999.
 
Impact of the failed discharge
•	TW experienced a life-threatening medical emergency shortly after discharge.
•	Lack of medication and clinical handover compromised her safety.
•	Staff were placed under extreme pressure to respond to an avoidable crisis.
•	This incident demonstrates a failure in discharge planning and communication, breaching fundamental standards of care.

Lack of Diagnostic Progress
For over a year, I have experienced severe, disabling symptoms, including:

Joint pain up to 9/10 affecting hands, knees, and feet

Daily swelling, stiffness, and reduced mobility

Near-complete symptom relief in warm climates, with symptoms returning immediately in cold or damp UK conditions

New neurological symptoms, including numbness and tingling extending into my hands, arms, and feet

Despite consistent symptom patterns and multiple consultations, I have not been given a working diagnosis or a clear investigative plan. My concerns have not been adequately addressed.

2. Concerns About Equitable and Consistent Care
I am increasingly concerned that I have not received the same urgency, continuity, or depth of investigation typically afforded to patients presenting with similar symptoms. Over the past year:

My symptoms have been repeatedly minimised despite the substantial impact on my daily functioning.

No proactive or comprehensive investigations have been initiated, even as new and worsening symptoms have developed.

I have had to continually advocate for myself just to obtain basic follow-up or clarification.

Given the well-documented disparities in healthcare outcomes for certain demographic groups, I am concerned that my age and race may be contributing to the lack of urgency and incomplete assessment I have received. My health has deteriorated while I remain without answers, leaving me feeling dismissed, unsupported, and significantly distressed.

Initially reassured, she was later told there might be fluid on the baby's brain and referred to fetal medicine. At the follow-up on 5 November, she was informed the baby had severe brain abnormalities and would be profoundly disabled, with termination advised.
She underwent a termination procedure on 7 November, followed by induction and delivery of her stillborn son, Bobby, on 10 November. The complainant reports multiple failures, including:

Delayed detection of possible brain abnormality.
Distressing communication and pressure to terminate without full exploration of options.
Poor bereavement care: no bereavement midwife present at birth, inadequate cooling measures, incorrect clothing, and lack of memory-making items.
Prolonged, traumatic induction process with inconsistent plans, lack of food, and minimal support.
Failure to preserve baby's body properly, reducing time for family to spend with him.
Later discovery that the baby might have survived with treatment (e.g., shunt), raising concerns about misdiagnosis and unnecessary termination.

The complainant states these failures caused severe emotional trauma, loss of trust, and lasting mental health impact.","09.12.25 - EMAIL - Ella Vitue allocated to Dawn Holmes and Tracy Gadd for comments by 29.12.2025(JD)

We were told initially that it may have been bank staff. She said she would investigate. The next day sister Ellen accompanied by sister Lailamma asked my wife into a room for a meeting. Sister Ellen then admitted that she, along with two others, had transferred me to the bed. Both Sisters then proceeded to profusely apologise for what they said may have been a'joke' and taken the wrong way.

The complainant wishes to chase her referral to the Pain Team made by T&O. She is aware that the current wait time exceeds 18 months and feels this is too long, given that she has been seeking support for her injury since 2021 and has had multiple referrals to other teams (spinal therapy and consultant) without a clear treatment plan. She has confirmed that she has no concerns regarding the care and treatment provided by the clinical team and does not wish to pursue a formal complaint. Her request is specifically for assistance in progressing her Pain Team referral. Forwarded complaint to PALS team and requested it be logged as PALS concern- once confirmed PALS picking up case - I will update the complainant and close the formal complaint.

I am extremely concerned by the way we were spoken to and the overall attitude displayed during the consultation. From the beginning of the appointment, the doctor did not introduce herself, acknowledge us properly, or make any effort to create a safe or respectful environment. Her manner was rude, dismissive, and patronising throughout the consultation. When I began explaining my child's symptoms and the concerns I had—based on what we had observed at home—she interrupted me and sarcastically asked whether I was a health professional. When I replied that I was not, she responded again in a sarcastic tone: ""Oh, so you just read up then."" This was completely unnecessary, unprofessional, and made me feel belittled for simply trying to provide relevant information to support an accurate assessment of my child. I had brought a urine sample with me, as I believed it might assist in identifying the cause of my child's symptoms. The doctor pushed it away with a hand gesture and said, ""I don't understand why you have brought that,"" showing no interest in considering any information I provided. I also explained that my child had been in significant pain the day before and had struggled to walk. In response, the doctor instructed my child to stand up and jump. My child complied only because they were made to feel embarrassed and uncomfortable, not because they were pain-free. During the brief examination, the doctor placed a pulse oximeter on my child's finger but did not look at or record the readings. She simply left it on and walked away, and I eventually had to remove it myself. Although my child was not showing many symptoms at the time of the appointment, I believe it is important to seek medical attention when there are concerns about something potentially serious, such as a grumbling appendix. I attended the hospital purely to raise my concerns and ensure my child was safe. Instead of being listened to, I was completely dismissed. Overall, I left the appointment feeling unheard, disrespected, and deeply concerned about the lack of care and attention shown toward both myself and my child. This experience has undermined our confidence in the care we should be able to expect from NHS staff. I request that this matter be investigated and that appropriate steps are taken to address the doctor's behaviour. I would also like confirmation that feedback will be used to prevent similar experiences for other patients in the future. Thank you for your attention.

I had been referred by 111 to go to the hospital. My boyfriend, who does not live with me, went to A&E for his own health conditions. We both bumped into each other in A&E. During this period of time, I had found out that a registered nurse in A&E named Noreen had broken confidentiality and disclosed my personal notes with another patient without my consent and had given her opinions on my relationship with my boyfriend. She questioned my boyfriend about a crash that was in my notes and had revealed and discussed my notes with him when I was not present or aware of this. My boyfriend did not know about the crash and has now been revealed without my permission or consent. Noreen, the nurse, had also questioned my relationship with my boyfriend, and she advised him to ""block me"" and ""remove me from his life"". She also stated to my boyfriend that ""I am not a good woman and that he should leave me""; she was also asking him whether I should be told to leave the hospital, and she had taken his belongings into a private room. I was not aware of this at the time, and the comments that Noreen made resulted in my boyfriend having a panic attack as she was giving her opinions on me. She also questioned him about whether he loves me, and she also discussed my notes with my boyfriend, which he did not know about from me. She had discussed with him that I had been in and out of the hospital, I had discharged myself and had mentioned the crash. I kept the car crash that I experienced on a down low and kept it to myself due to the mental trauma and effect it had upon me, and now he has knowledge of this, which I am not happy about.

This was due to worsening symptoms of thoracic pain, shortness of breath on minimal exertion and an abnormal d-dimer blood test and Chest X-ray showing signs of pulmonary oedema and with a constant dry cough. On this evening she was assessed, given anticoagulant medication and advised to return the next day for a CT scan with contrast in the day assessment unit to investigate any possible PE. This scan was completed on the morning of the 23/9/25 and we were seen by a senior consultant radiologist (I am unsure of his name) whom advised there was no PE and he advised her symptoms where musculoskeletal - something which at the time both myself (a senior advanced MSK physiotherapist of nearly 13 years) and her GP disputed as her symptoms were non-mechanical in nature. This ended our contact with this clinician and we had not heard from him or aware of his details until last Friday 14/11/25 where by during this time my mothers symptoms of shortness of breath, thoracic pain and cough had deteriorated, she had a further chest x-ray whereby a greater level of plural effusion was found and subsequently via an A&E admission was referred for a second CT scan on the cancer 2 week urgent care pathway. This scan was completed on 30/10 and an urgent referral was sent to the chest clinic. Worsening symptoms led to a second A&E referral whereby 3.5 litres of fluid was found on the lung with a tumor noted on the lung - at the chest clinic app on 14/11 the senior respiratory consultant advised that the cancer was present on the first CT scan completed in the day ax unit at Heartlands and this was not picked up by the reviewing consultant on the morning of the 23/9. We have been advised there is already an internal investigation being started via Ben Sutton at the QE however my question is simply - why did a senior radiology consultant not review my mothers scan fully and consider looking for a cancerous tumour in the lung with reported symptoms of shortness of breath, thoracic chest pain, a persistent cough with an abnormal d-dimer bloods test and signs of pleural effusion on an x-ray. This cancer diagnosis has been missed for a further 6 weeks - this has led to 2 further A&E admissions, loss of diagnosis time and access to treatment earlier and more stress for my mum and all of us as a family. We would like to query medical negligence from the reviewing clinician at Heartlands hospital.",26.11.25 ST - Launched to Acute Medicine triage for allocation.

A big concern was symptoms I had and the fact I was pregnant. I was clearly very anxious and worried as I was in my first trimester and showing some signs of miscarriage. After waiting I was called through to have observations taken and the nurse said the hospital needed to do a urine sample to check my pregnancy. After 8 hours of sitting in the waiting room waiting to see a doctor, anxious to know what what going on and worrying about my pregnancy, I decided to go and ask a member of staff to check sample results and when I was likely to see a doctor. After asking, she checked on the system and very casually said that my pregnancy test was now negative. In that moment it was clear I was having a miscarriage, but to be told this information in a room full of people, with no sensitivity or compassion whatsoever made it so much worse to hear. And why I was not told this result after my urine was checked is disgraceful (I was waiting 8hours before I went and asked, I wonder how long it would have taken had I not have asked). I am appalled at the service and how I was just left sitting there for so long, worrying and wondering about the fate of my pregnancy, based on the symptoms that sent me to the department. The way the news was given to me has made this so much harder as well, I am really let down by the service today.

She was fit, had an allotment, attended dancing lessons and is a driver. On Monday 15 Sept Mrs Parkes had a fall at home in garden. She waited 4 hours for an ambulance and then 6 hours outside A&E. Once admitted to AMU diagnosed with broken wrist and broken pubic bones. Treated on that ward until Thursday 16 Sept at 08.00. Elizabeth was then transported by wheelchair to Harborne Ward, Heritage Building. I had spoken to Elizabeth on the day before, phoned again on the Thursday afternoon when she told me she had been sitting on a chair on the ward since 8 am waiting for a bed. I visited her at about 6 pm to find she was still in the chair (now for 10 hours). She was very tearful. The chair was by the entrance to a very busy bay , staff in and out. Elizabeth had requested another chair to rest her injured leg. She also asked for a pillow so she could rest her head on a nearby table. Doctor had told her to stand up once an hour. No help from staff to do that. I saw nurse at station who informed me that Matron was well aware of situation, AMU needed bed (understandable). I was astounded by what I saw. I was asked to leave ward at 7 pm but refused so that I could make sure she was in a bed. Finally at 8 pm Elizabeth was given a bed (12 hours in that chair). At 8pm I was shouted by a nurse to go home just after Liz got into the bed. During her time on the ward she was given little or no help to wash. She became dehydrated and was hallucinating. I kept her next of kin, brother Robert (who lives 200 miles away in Kent), informed. Eventually discharged home with support because of injuries and accessing upstairs bathroom. Brother Robert did visit from Kent on a number of occasions. We were horrified that Elizabeth sat in a chair for 12 hours. Elizabeth herself was very grateful for the care given by most of the staff on the ward although there were a couple of occasions when she was shouted at for walking to the toilet when told to walk more by a doctor. Overall it was a distressing stay in Harborne ward. I saw a notice on door to bay which said a member of staff should be present in bay at all times. This did not happen.

The neglect of care, lack of compassion, bedside manner and the non adherence to the trust values was portrayed throughout my grand mothers stay. She also had an unsafe discharge which resulted her in becoming critically unwell 48hrs later. There was unclear and unconsistent communication throughout her admission. On one occassion she had deteriorated on the night, her next of kin was not updated or contacted about a change in her condition. My grandad was very upset the next morming when he came in to see her like this. She was a high risk falls patient due to her low sodium and confusion. She had a fall in the bathroom where she was unattended and unassisted. She had multiple scans but we were not told about the results until a few days later despite asking multiple times. Regular pain relief was not given to her despite her asking, she felt ignored due to her language barrier. She developed a blood stream infection, staphylococcus aureus. This was secondary to the phelebitis on her left arm where she had a cannula, the medical team or nursing staff did not apologise about this incident. This extended her stay in hospital. Nursing staff came to administer my grandmother's IV medication, they sometimes had no intention of flushing the cannula but just to attach the medication. Gloves were not worn when giving IV medication. She had a cannula in her hand for more than 72hrs, the cannula was inserted on 17/10/25 and was still being used all the way up until the 22/10/25 for her antbiotics. During morning ward round it was made clear that she needed IV fluids and steriods, due to her poor kidney function these were not given till late afternoon. There was a lack of unprofessionalism and communication from senior members of staff. We wanted to speak to the ward manager about issues that had occured during my grandmother's admission, however this never happened when we requested. The ward manager was also very rude and unprofessional with an encounter she had with my mother about some water spilled on the floor by my grandmother's bedspace. She made it seemed that it was her fault the water was on the floor. We escalated my grandmother's work of breathing on multiple occassions and explained this was not normal for her. However, we were dismissed and was told that this is normal for a ""cardiac patient"". The day of discharge she had a low grade temperature of 37.9, but to the nursing staff it seemed this was not enough for it to be a ""temperature spike"". 48hrs later my grandmother was taken to QE where she was in respiratory acidosis and multiple organ failure.

2. Why the commitment regarding when my scan would take place on Thursday was not fulfilled, despite my symptoms persisting and the doctor acknowledging that my pain could be related to my ovary? I am appalled that a major reproductive organ with two key functions (hormone production and fertility) was identified as being at risk, yet wasn't investigated promptly. Ovarian torsion is a medical emergency.

3. Why my transfer to the Birminghan Women's Hospital was delayed for over six hours, despite multiple hospital porters affirming that it would have been possible to wheel me across to the Birmingham Women's Hospital, and get me there sooner in spite of ambulance availability? My ultrasound scan had shown an abnormally enlarged right ovary which did not demonstrate any bloodflow within it, suggesting ovarian torsion, yet l wasn't urgently transferred to a ward/department/hospital who could operate on me and carry out organ-saving surgery. 

4. Why a copy of my ultrasound scan was not given to me to take to the Birmingham Women's Hospital? This caused further delay to my diagnosis and treatment. My ovary, a major reproductive organ, had already been identified as being at risk by the time I was being transferred to the Birmingham Women's Hospital. 

5. What measures the Trust will put in place to ensure that such failings don't occur again for patients presenting with similar symptoms?

1.	Yasmin did not delay treatment because of the pain she was experiencing. No treatment was offered to Yasmin. 
2. A bone density scan was only offered l, after Yasmin questioned 
why she Was experiencing such pain and her Daughter Jade insisting 
her Mother have a bone density scan in the hope of finding out 
why Yasmin was in extreme Pain.  
3. I was present with Yasmin when we saw the Cancer Nurse regarding
What medication Yasmin would be required to take prior to the start of 
Her Chemotherapy, and I requested that Yasmin needed to see either her
own Consultant or a Dr off the Cancer ward as I was concerned that Yasmin
now had Yellow Jaundice and unexplained bruises on her lower back.
I can assure you we were told to make an appointment to see Yasmin's own 
GP. It was only because at this point I insisted the Nurse go and fetch
someone to assess Yasmin as I would not be taking my sister 
anywhere explaining that Yasmin's GP was not a Cancer specialist. The Nurse relented and bought in Dr Riaz. It was after Dr Riaz examined Yasmin that my sister was admitted Into the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

The damage was already done by the time she ended up in hospital, why wasn't it spotted sooner? We were stole of the chance to say good bye.
Why did no one prepare us? 
Why did the consultant on the 1st June state that after looking at the scans for an hour that he was confident it was an infection that could be treated and that we should see an improvement in 5 days for her to die on the 2nd?

She remained in that ambulance for 5 hours. She was considerably unwell and uncomfortable. The ambulance crew were Fran and Callum. I think that it was ambulance number 4275. Issues:

 

Bloods to check for a heart attack were not taken despite persistent efforts by Fran for some time. When this was finally done, Fran was initially given an incorrect result reading of circa 20. She felt that Mum was too unwell for this to be accurate and repeatedly took the heart rate scans back into A&E to try and get help. It transpired that she was given the wrong readings and the actual rate was circa 770 and escalating (this peaked at 15,000 – and was deemed to be a significant heart attack). No hospital care was given to Mum despite Fran's repeated calls to action.
Fran reported that there were 2 free bays in A&E and had to chase the medic in charge to notice this and actually admit Mum. We finally went into Resus after 10am ish
Based on the fact that Mum is 89, was clearly in trouble, has dementia and had a history of heart attacks, we were rather left to it for much of the morning. The A&E doctor (Hind) took history but not much more was done. We were moved to Majors after lunch and it was suggested that a bed on Ward 23 Cardio (the site of all of the issues last time as per the complaint) had happened.
Admitting Mum has challenges for her due to her dementia – she won't eat and gets terribly upset whilst in hospital. My elderly father and I took shifts to cover her as much as possible. We were promised follow up bloods and monitoring (the whole point of admitting her) but my father had to chase this on the ward at 8pm that night as no one had done anything.
When the Cardio consultant did finally arrive on ward rounds – circa 5pm on Saturday 29th – he was arguing with my elderly father that he wanted to admit Mum to Heartlands for an 'intervention'. She does not want this and we – with full power of attorney for her – do not think this in her best interests either. We had a letter from our private consultant – the Cardio clinical lead for your area, Professor Leyva and My Khan (cardio surgeon at UHB) suggesting that an intervention was very high risk and voting against this. When faced with a lack of meek compliance from us, the cardio consultant rather lost interest in  my Mum.
My father saw him again for ward rounds the next day and this was played out again – unhelpfully.
I have sat with my Mum for hours across the last 4 days. No nursing staff have one in all that time checked that she is eating and drinking – had we not been there, she would have been significantly dehydrated. We waited 5 hours yesterday for them to find meds and the discharge letter. All of the nursing staff on Ward 23 seem to sit and chat rather than check in on patients. I repeatedly asked for paracetamol for her pain – this took on average 1.5 hours to arrive.","24/12/25 - OM - Comments received from Ward 23 - everyone has responded, to attempt a draft and see if more is needed

On 16th October, Natasha absconded from West 1 Ward at UHB while suffering from a
suspected blood clot.
The police were called but left her at an unsafe address, despite professionals knowing that
the resident had a history of violence, coercive control, and financial abuse towards her.
On 17th October, UHB sent an ambulance to collect her, but she was again left at the
property, even though she had not received any medication and was severely unwell.
• Natasha's social worker and safeguarding leads had previously applied a MARAC for her
protection, but it was never renewed after it lapsed — despite repeated family requests.

5.	The way my reasonable attempts to confirm, clarify and preserve my long awaited surgery date have been interpreted as ""alarming"" and used to justify further psychiatric hurdles instead of honest, direct communication about risks and options.
6.	The overall pattern of poor communication, shifting criteria, and delay, which has prolonged my distress, worsened my ADHD related difficulties and left my original surgical problems unresolved seven years on.

On Friday 14th February, patient had a CT scan that showed he had Metastatic Lung Cancer that had spread to his liver. This news was a huge shock to family and would've been devastating news to patient. 
Over the past 18 months, patient had had numerous blood tests and x-rays for various things. He had also been seen by many Doctors at the GP surgery and at hospital appointments.
Metastatic Cancer is Stage 4 Cancer so not something that suddenly appears. Family want to know if anything was missed during any consultation with a GP or a Doctor at any hospital appointment or from any of the blood tests and x-rays that patient had. 
Family have many questions but main question is that why the cancer was not picked up sooner, considering the amount of medical appointments patient had.

In February this year I was moved onto the Medtronic pump under the advice of the hospital to help improve my diabetic control. 
The improvement was literally over night and after a few days the pump was put into ""smartguard"" mode which to full control of my diabetic control. Within a matter of weeks my hba1c went from 75 down to 55. 
In May this year I attended the eye clinic at the QE as I suffer with severe diabetic retinopathy. I was told that my eyes were looking very good but they did warn me that a sudden improvement in my blood sugars could lead to complications. I did not fully understand what they meant but assumed that the diabetic team had this in hand and were aware of any complications. 
On the 22nd October I woke up and I had lost all sight in my right eye due to a diabetic haemorrhage. 
I am now 7 weeks down the line with no improvement in my sight. I am off work, I am unable to drive, to exercise at the gym, it is impacting on every aspect of my life. I am suffering from daily Headaches and nausea. My depression and anxiety have returned, I have missed important meetings and targets at work. I am missing out on social events and celebrations for my wife's 60th birthday. I cannot go out at night, I cannot judge simple distances even eating a meal is not a nice experience due to blurred vision
I need answers as to why every healthcare professional I have seen since the haemorrhage has said this is a common side effect of rapid improvement in diabetic control and yet, I was never told this by the team and more importantly, there was no attempt to put in place a more gradual reduction in target blood sugars which could have been done so easily via the pump. The target blood sugar could have been gradually reduced over 3,6,9 or 12 months but there was no attempt to mitigate this terrible side effect. 
I don't know if I will get my sight back or if indeed my other eye could also still be in danger. 
Since the 22nd I have had numerous injections in my eye and laser treatment.

COM-2761,15-Dec-25,10-Feb-26,,,Lorna Lawrence,BHH Exec Team,Acute and Short Stay Medicine BHH,CDG 1BI,Heartlands Hospital,,Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) BHH (Heartlands Hospital Site),Comments requested,,Complaint - Formal,MP,Communications,Communication with patient,,,"I am writing to formally raise serious concerns regarding the content and conduct surrounding my recent medical experience report authored by Dr Awais Raees and E Hayton.

I am requesting the immediate removal of this report from my medical records due to factual inaccuracies, inappropriate clinical conclusions, and what I believe to be discriminatory practice rooted in age and gender based bias and stereotyping.

I will also be formally raising this matter with my local Member of Parliament, Jess Phillips MP, whom I will be copying into this correspondence. As a longstanding and prominent advocate for women's rights and for addressing gender based inequality within public services, I believe it is appropriate that she is made aware of my experience and the concerns it raises regarding the treatment of women within clinical settings. This case reflects wider and well documented patterns of gender bias and dismissal of women's symptoms in healthcare, and I consider it a matter of public interest as well as personal significance that it is scrutinised appropriately.

On Saturday 13 December, I attended the Same Day Emergency Care clinic at Heartlands Hospital following a referral from my GP. This referral was made due to ongoing abdominal and neuropathic pain, vomiting, unstable blood glucose levels, and an unintentional weight loss of five kilograms within one month, alongside other concerning symptoms. I have a long standing diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes with unstable glycemic control and albuminuria, which was highly relevant to my presentation and clinical risk.

During this attendance, I was seen by two male doctors with no family or chaperone present. Throughout the consultation, I was repeatedly interrupted while attempting to explain my symptoms. My concerns were dismissed, and I was informed that I was depressed, despite not presenting with symptoms suggestive of depression or any other mental health condition. This conclusion appeared to have been reached without appropriate clinical assessment, exploration, or differential consideration. I am concerned that this judgement was influenced by my presentation as a young woman experiencing pain, rather than by an evidence based evaluation of my symptoms. I question whether a previously healthy, professionally active male patient experiencing two months of progressive, debilitating pain resulting in functional impairment and confinement to bed would have been so readily assigned a psychiatric explanation in the absence of supporting evidence.

My symptoms were not adequately explored, and I do not believe I was listened to in a meaningful or professional manner. Notably, my blood glucose records were not reviewed, despite clear evidence of instability reported by my GP and on my glucose monitor. Neuropathic pain, vomiting, and profound fatigue were described as general and non specific symptoms and attributed to depression, rather than being appropriately considered in the context of my long term diabetes and potential medical complications.
The discharge report contains multiple factual inaccuracies. It states that I demonstrated willingness to engage with mental health services, which is categorically untrue and was never expressed by me. In addition, the report records an incorrect weight. I was not weighed during this attendance, yet the report lists me as being four kilograms heavier than my current weight. This appears to be a historical value and therefore fails to acknowledge my rapid and clinically significant recent weight loss.

I do not agree with the mental health assessment documented in this report and strongly refute its validity. The conclusion was reached following a brief and dismissive interaction, without adequate history taking, investigation, or consideration of my existing medical conditions or any medical conditions that may not be identified through CT scans and repeats of the same basic blood tests. I have been formally diagnosed with elevated microalbumin, high resting heart rate, gallbladder wall thickening and polyps - all empirical and verifiable evidence reported at Heartlands Hospital and not features of the diagnostic criteria for depression. I believe this represents unconscious bias and discriminatory practice.

In this regard, I wish to explicitly reference the General Medical Council's guidance set out in Good Medical Practice. This guidance is clear that doctors must treat patients as individuals, listen carefully to their accounts, and avoid making assumptions or clinical judgements based on personal characteristics such as gender. It also makes clear that stereotyping and unconscious bias can undermine safe and effective care and compromise clinical decision making - especially in persistent physical symptoms. I am concerned that these standards were not upheld in my case.

I would also like to clarify my professional background, as it directly informs my perspective. I am a qualified secondary and college level educator who works closely with vulnerable young people, including students with Education Health and Care Plans and those with complex mental health needs. Through my professional role, I have a strong understanding of mental health conditions and their impact, and I do not attach stigma, shame, or dismissal to mental health diagnoses. My concern is not with mental health being considered where clinically appropriate, but with the timing, framing, and weighting of such conclusions in a case involving unresolved physical symptoms and objective findings.

Following the consultation, I was left waiting for a further four hours with a cannula still in situ and without any pain relief. I was not informed that I had been discharged. It was only after I approached a nurse myself that I was told I should have been sent home several hours earlier.

This type of bias has serious implications for patient safety and trust in medical care. Inaccurate and prejudicial documentation of this nature risks undermining future clinical assessments and delaying appropriate diagnosis and treatment. I wish to emphasise that I have only attended hospital services following GP advice and through the appropriate referral pathways.
